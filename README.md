# üå∏ Hikari Listener

**Hikari** is an **AI-based system** with a user interface built using **Streamlit**.
It utilizes the **Qwen1.5** model in combination with **task-specific LoRA adapters** for sentence generation and user translation rating.
For **text-to-speech synthesis**, it supports the **Suno/Bark** models or **Google TTS** as a lightweight alternative for systems without **CUDA** or with low performance.

## ‚ú® Features

* üîÑ **Text generation** with custom user configuration
* üß© **Listening exercises** with context-specific generation
* üöÄ **Automatic checking and rating** of user translations
* üéõÔ∏è **User statistics dashboard** (accuracy, activity, and progress tracking)

## üó∫Ô∏è RoadMap

#### DONE:
- Develop a preview of the WEB-UI using StreamLit
- Research, evaluation, and selection of models
- Implementation of basic functionality
- Generate preview dataset (currently in use) for fine-tuning LoRA adapters
- Fine-tuning LoRA adapters for each task and improving inference
- Add the TTS model (suno/bark)
- Add a listening page with colordiff and user translation rating
- Add a statistics page for activity and ratings
- Add Google-TTS for low-performance PCs

#### TO DO:
- Develop an API for functionality
- Development of utilities for expanding datasets
- Expanding the dataset with new utilities
- Re-fine-tuning with a new data set to improve inference results
- Enhance the listening page with detailed translation feedback
- Add a new type of WEB-UI (HTML + CSS / Gradio)
- Further improvements and features to be determined later
